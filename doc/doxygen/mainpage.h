  \section intro_sec Introduction

  This project provides the Copperhead Compiler library, which can be
   used to build data parallel compilers.

   The library provides a set of Abstract Syntax Tree \ref nodes
   "nodes" that describe the text of a program, as well as a set
   of \ref rewriters "rewriters", each of which transform the program
   in a particular way.  These rewriters can be combined to form a
   particular compiler, such as \ref backend::compiler "this one",
   which is used as the compiler for the Python Copperhead runtime.
